// mapQueryFailures remembers the command stream whose map command failed,
// e.g. an older client's query that this dserver no longer accepts (such as
// one selecting count(x) twice). A client sends the map command before its
// read commands; without an aggregate those reads would stream every line as
// plain payload to a client waiting for MapReduce results (an older dmap
// writes a header-only outfile and exits 0, an older dtail --query or
// continuous job streams for ever). So every later read of that stream is
// rejected instead, and the session ends with its normal close handshake once
// no command is left.
//
// A command stream is one session generation: generation 0 for the legacy
// command stream of a connection, and each SESSION START or UPDATE generation
// of an interactive session. A failure of one generation therefore does not
// affect the reads of another, e.g. of a later successful :reload. A map
// command counts as failed when it can not be built (handleMapCommand) and
// when dispatchCommand rejects it before its handler runs (commandRejected).
// A failure is cleared when a map command of its generation succeeds and when
// a SESSION START or UPDATE (re)uses its generation: a retried SESSION START
// reuses generation 1, and the client may number an UPDATE as an earlier,
// rejected one, possibly without a query. Sessions whose map command
// succeeded, and sessions without one, are not affected.

	// generation holds the failed generation plus one, so 0 means none. Only
	// the last failure is kept: a client starts a new generation only after
	// the previous one's commands were dispatched.

// rejectAfterMapQueryFailure tells the client that this read does not run
// because the map command of its command stream failed. It reports the
// failure with the same fixed reason as the map command, which clients
// de-duplicate and the scheduler counts as a transport failure, so a
// scheduled job writes no outfile (see protocol.IsFileReadFailure). The
// message names the file as the user gave it (see rejectedReadPath).

// rejectedReadPath returns the file word of a read command's args for a
// diagnostic. A path containing a space or starting with base64% travels
// encoded (protocol.EncodeReadPath), so it is decoded back to the path the
// user gave; a word that does not decode is returned as sent, since the read
// is rejected anyway and the diagnostic should still show what arrived.
