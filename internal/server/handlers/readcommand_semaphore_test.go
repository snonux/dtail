// TestReadSemaphoreNotStolenOnCancelBeforeAcquire is a negative test
// (regression guard) for the semaphore-slot-stealing bug.
//
// Root cause: the original defer unconditionally performed a non-blocking
// receive from the limiter channel regardless of whether this goroutine had
// actually acquired a slot. When a goroutine was cancelled by ctx.Done()
// before it sent to the limiter, the defer still ran and drained one slot
// that belonged to a different goroutine. The real holder's own defer would
// then drain yet another slot, permanently reducing the semaphore capacity.
//
// Fix: track a local `acquired bool` flag; only drain the slot in the defer
// when acquired == true.
//
// The test fills the limiter to capacity, then spins up N goroutines that
// all call read() with a pre-cancelled context. None of them should ever
// acquire a slot, so after all goroutines exit the limiter must still hold
// exactly `cap(limiter)` items. Before the fix each goroutine would steal
// one slot, draining the semaphore below capacity and preventing legitimate
// future acquires.
