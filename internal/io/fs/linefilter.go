// LineFilter applies one session's regex, local context (before, after and
// max) and line numbering to lines fed to it from outside a ReadFile, for
// example by a shared reader that fans one file out to several sessions. It
// uses the same filter as a private ReadFile, so a session sees the same lines
// with the same numbers either way.
//
// A LineFilter has line statistics of its own: the first line fed to it is
// line 1, exactly like the first line a private follow reader reads after
// seeking to the end of the file. Which lines to feed, and in which form, is
// the caller's choice, and must match the private reader of the same mode for
// the output to match: the snapshot reader feeds every line including its
// trailing newline (empty lines too), the follow reader feeds lines without
// the newline and skips empty ones.
//
// A LineFilter is not safe for concurrent use; one goroutine feeds it.
