// An evicted session reads privately only until it caught up: whenever its
// private reader reaches the end of the file at the start of a line, at
// offset P of file F, the session rejoins the shared reader of its file if
// that reader has F open and has neither read past P nor published a line
// ending past P yet (see entry.rejoin), or starts a new shared reader at P
// when there is none. The private reader then stops without reading past P, and the session skips the
// published lines that end at or before P, so it gets every line of the file
// once, with the same filter and processor, like one private read. Otherwise
// it goes on privately and tries again at a later end of the file, after a
// pause that grows with every declined attempt and every eviction soon after
// a rejoin, so that a session too slow for the shared reader does not
// alternate between it and a private reader all the time.
