// Package readhub shares reads of a file between dserver sessions: one follow
// read between the sessions that tail the file (Hub.Follow), and one snapshot
// read between the members of a scheduled job group (Hub.ReadOnce). One reader
// per file reads, decompresses and splits the file into lines once and fans
// the lines out to every subscribed session. Each session keeps its own regex,
// local context, line numbering and processor, applied by an fs.LineFilter on
// the session's own goroutine, so a session sees the lines it would see from a
// private read, apart from where a follow session starts (see Hub.Follow).

// Follow feeds session with the lines appended to its file from now on, from
// the file's shared reader, which it starts if no other session follows the
// file. It blocks like a private follow read and returns nil once ctx ends,
// ErrStopped when the session's max-count limit ended the read, and a
// processor error or ErrReaderFailed together with fs.ErrReaderWorkerPanic
// (the shared reader panicked) otherwise. After ErrStopped or an error, a
// private reader would start over; the caller decides how to continue.
//
// Like a private follow read, which starts at the end of the file when it
// opens it, a session starts at the end of the file at the path when it
// joins: it skips published lines that were in the file already, also while
// the shared reader still reads a file the path was rotated away from before
// the join, or has not yet noticed that the file was truncated before it, and
// it keeps its processor until it gets a line. Two differences remain. When
// the join falls in the middle of a line, the private reader delivers the
// rest of that line, a shared session that whole line. And a trailing line
// the file's writer has not finished yet is not delivered when the session
// leaves, unlike the private reader, which passes such a fragment on when its
// read is cancelled.
//
// A session that falls behind by more than Options.QueueChunks chunks is
// evicted, so it never delays the other sessions: it handles what it has
// queued, including the rotation, truncation or failure that did not fit, and
// goes on with a private follow reader of its own target, just past the last
// line it handled, with the same filter and processor. A session whose shared
// reader failed without a panic goes on privately the same way. Every session
// holds a descriptor of its own of the file the shared reader has open (see
// heldFile), which that private reader reads first, so a rotation of the path
// costs the session no line, whether it came before the eviction, while the
// shared reader was still behind in the old file, or after it. Only when the
// path is rotated in the moment between the shared reader opening a file and
// the session opening its descriptor of it, does a session lack one; if it
// is then evicted after the rotation with lines of that file unread, its
// private reader reads the new file from its beginning with a new processor
// and warns that the rest of the old file is not read. An evicted session
// rejoins the shared reader once its private reader caught up with it: when
// the private reader reaches the end of the file at the start of a line
// that the shared reader has neither read nor published past yet, while that
// reader is not in the middle of a read, or it starts a new
// shared reader there when there is none, with the same filter and processor
// and without losing or repeating a line (see rejoin.go). A session evicted
// again soon after it rejoined waits longer before it rejoins once more.
