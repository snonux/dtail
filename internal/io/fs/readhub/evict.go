// A subscriber whose queue is full when the shared reader publishes is
// evicted instead of making the reader, and so every other session of the
// file, wait for it. The evicted session handles what it has queued, then
// goes on with a private follow reader of its own that starts just past the
// last line it handled and feeds the session's filter and processor, so it
// loses no line and keeps its line numbering and local context. That reader
// first reads the session's descriptor of the file the shared reader had open
// at the eviction (see heldFile), so a rotation of the path, before the
// eviction while the shared reader was still behind in the old file or while
// the session handles its queue, does not cost it the rest of the old file.
// Once the private reader caught up, the session rejoins a shared reader (see
// rejoin.go).

// evict stops deliveries to sub, whose queue had no room for missed, and
// tells it to go on privately. The caller holds e.publishMu, so nothing is
// queued after the eviction. An entry left without subscribers is closed, so
// that no session joins it any more, and stops.
