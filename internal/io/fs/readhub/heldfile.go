// Every subscriber holds a descriptor of its own of the file the shared
// reader has open, so that when it is evicted, or the shared reader fails, its
// private reader goes on in that file even if the path was rotated away from
// it meanwhile: the shared reader may still be behind in the old file then,
// with the evicted session's last line in it. Each descriptor is a separate
// open of the file, never a dup, so that private readers do not share a file
// offset, and it is opened through the subscriber's own validated target and
// kept only if it is the file the reader has open, so a session only ever gets
// a descriptor of the file it legitimately reads. It costs every session one
// descriptor, as a private reader would.

// heldFile is a subscriber's descriptor of the file the shared reader has
// open, or nil. It is replaced whenever the reader opens a file, dropped when
// the reader announces a new read, and taken over by the session's private
// reader, or closed when the session's read ends.
