// Unlike ProcessLine, ProcessRawLine does not transfer ownership: raw is
// borrowed and only valid for the duration of the call (it typically aliases a
// bufio.Scanner token or a reused partial-line buffer). An implementation must
// copy whatever it needs before returning and must not retain raw or any
// sub-slice of it. There is nothing to recycle on any return path.
//
// Readers use it only where a line is emitted without local context
// (before/after/max), because the context path has to keep lines beyond the

// processor could not tell the rewritten content from the old one.
//
// The reader calls SourceRestarted from the goroutine that calls ProcessLine,
// after the last line of the old content and before the first line of the new
// content. Readers do not call it when a source ends or is reopened with a new
// Processor (rotation), because that Processor starts with fresh state anyway.

// goroutine that calls ProcessLine, before every Flush, with the byte offset
// just past the last complete line it fed and the identity of the open file.
// The offset excludes a trailing line the reader has not finished yet.
// Readers of compressed files and snapshot readers never call it.
