  - Turbo: 21.05 MB/sec
  - **Improvement: 55.5%**

- **Min/Max query**:
  - v4.3.0: 17.46 MB/sec
  - Turbo: 21.80 MB/sec
  - **Improvement: 24.9%**

- **Multi-field query**:
  - v4.3.0: 21.85 MB/sec
  - Turbo: 21.32 MB/sec
  - **Slight decrease: -2.4%** (within margin of error)

## Key Findings

1. **Massive improvements in DCat and DGrep**: The turbo boost mode shows extraordinary performance gains for file reading (DCat) and searching (DGrep) operations, with improvements ranging from 14x to 26x faster.

2. **Moderate improvements in DMap**: MapReduce operations show more modest but still significant improvements of 25-55% for most query types.

3. **Consistent performance across hit rates**: DGrep performance improvements scale well across different hit rates, with even better improvements at higher hit rates.

## Technical Details

The turbo boost mode achieves these improvements through:
- Direct writing bypassing channels for cat/grep/tail operations
- Direct line processing without channels for MapReduce in server mode
- Batch processing to reduce lock contention
- Memory pooling to reduce garbage collection pressure

## Recommendation

The turbo boost mode delivers exceptional performance improvements and should remain enabled by default. The performance gains are substantial enough to justify any potential trade-offs in code complexity.
