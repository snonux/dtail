This is a loose list of what to do. Maybe for the next releae or maybe for a later one.

[x] Finalize default color schema
[x] Use a buffered string builder for brushing the colors in the client.
[x] Extended color table output (print whole paragraphs in colors)
[x] Have different color conf sections (by REMOTE, CLIENT, SERVER)
[x] Paint ^CLIENT messages (e.g. use yellow backgrounds here)
[x] Paint ^SERVER messages (e.g. use cyan backgrounds here)
[x] Adjust dmap with color schemas
[x] Auto limit stdout map output to 10 results.
[ ] Fix JSONSchema for the colors
[ ] Implement Benchmark cat-ing a file and compare to prev version.
[?] Client 4.x should print a warning when trying to connect to a 3.x server.
[ ] Update docs for color configuration
[ ] Update animated gifs
[ ] Canary/RC deployment
[x] Fix dmap so that it always reads to the end of file
