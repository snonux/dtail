DTail (a distributed tail program) is a DevOps tool for engineers programmed in Google Go for following (tailing), catting and grepping (including gzip and zstd decompression support) log files on many machines concurrently. An advanced feature of DTail is to execute distributed MapReduce aggregations across many devices.

For secure authorization and transport encryption, the SSH protocol is used. Furthermore, DTail respects the UNIX file system permission model (traditional on all Linux/UNIX variants and also ACLs on Linux based operating systems).

The DTail binary operates in either client or server mode. The DTail server must be installed on all server boxes involved. The DTail client (possibly running on a regular Laptop) is used interactively to connect to the servers concurrently. That currently scales to multiple thousands of servers per client.
