# To-do's

* In turbo mode, Perform PGO  (profile-guided optimization) on the dcat, dgrep and dmap commands. Compare benchmarks before and after and create a new baseline for it in ./benchmarks/baselines. For the PGO, create a similar framework as the benchmarking. You can code the PGO procedure as an option to the dtail-tools command. Use the benchmark files for the PGO as a reference. Once implemented and working, you can remove this item from the todo list here.
