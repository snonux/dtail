DTail Query Language
====================

The query language allows you to run mapreduce queries on log files. This page intends to be a reference to the language.

## Prerequisites

For this to work, DTail needs to understand your log format. DTail already understands its own log format. You can have a look at all examples of the [examples](./examples.md) page using `-query` (these would be all examples of the `dmap` command, and some examples using the `dtail` command).

DTail also ships with a generic log format, which only allows you to run very basic queries. Check out the [log formats](./logformats.md) documentation for this.

To implement your own log format, please also check out the [log formats](./logformats.md) documentation.
