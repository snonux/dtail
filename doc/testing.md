DTail Testing Guide
===================

Currently, there are 3 different ways of how DTail can be tested.

1. Unit tests (automatic)
2. Integration tests (automatic)
3. Semi-manual tests with DTail server instances running in Docker.

## Quality control

Also, not actually testing, DTail is being linted and vetted before each release. For this run `make lint` and `make vet` at the top level source directory. Furthermore, to improve the quality of the software even more, the code is being scanned by SonarQube and Black Duck periodically. DTail is also audited and pen-tested by Mimecast staff. And, of course, new features are peer reviewed as well...

## Unit tests

To run all the unit tests simply run the following make command at the top level source directory:

```shell
% make test
```

It clears the Go test cache first (`go clean -testcache`) and then runs all
unit tests with `-race` (race detector) and `-shuffle=on` (randomized test
order) across every package. `go test ./...` does not abort on the first
failure: it reports results per package, so one package's failing tests do not
prevent the other packages from running (the make target still fails at the
end if any package failed).

## Integration tests

Other than the unit tests, which only test the internal code, the integration tests will run a set of DTail commands externally and thus simulating common end user scenarios.

This means, that you will need to compile all DTail binaries prior to running these tests:

```shell
# Not mandatory, but pest practise to delete all previously compiled binaries
% make clean 
# Now compile all the binaries (dtail, dcat, dmap, dserver...)
% make build
```

The integration tests can be enabled setting the following environment variable:

```
% export DTAIL_INTEGRATION_TEST_RUN_MODE=yes
```

To run the integration test together with all the unit tests, simply run `make test` in the top level source tree (with `DTAIL_INTEGRATION_TEST_RUN_MODE` exported). In case you only want to run the integration tests without the normal unit tests, the easiest way is the dedicated make target, which rebuilds the binaries and runs the integration tests with the run mode enabled:

```shell
% make test-integration
```

(If the binaries are already up to date and you want to skip the rebuild, the target is equivalent to:)

```shell
% go clean -testcache
% DTAIL_INTEGRATION_TEST_RUN_MODE=yes go test -v --race -count=1 ./integrationtests
```

**Important:** the integration tests launch the compiled DTail binaries, so
always rebuild (`make clean && make build`) after code changes before running
them — `make test-integration` does that rebuild for you.

## Semi-manual tests with DTail server instances running in Docker

### Requirements 

This assumes, that you have Docker up and running on your system. The Docker base image used by `docker/Dockerfile` (currently Fedora Linux) must match the GLIBC major version of the binaries you compiled locally, or you may run into issues; see the Dockerfile for the exact, current version.

This also assumes, that you have compiled all the DTail binaries already (with `make` in the top level source directory).

### Building DTail server Docker image

To build the `dserver` Docker image run:

```
% make -C docker
make: Entering directory '/home/paul/git/dtail/docker'
cp ../integrationtests/mapr_testdata.log .
cp ../dserver .
docker build . -t dserver:develop
Sending build context to Docker daemon  13.84MB
Step 1/11 : FROM fedora:42
---> dce66322d647
Step 2/11 : RUN mkdir -p /etc/dserver /var/run/dserver/ /var/log/dserver
.
.
.
Successfully built b44e92f7c066
Successfully tagged dserver:develop
rm ./dserver
rm ./mapr_testdata.log
make: Leaving directory '/home/paul/git/dtail/docker'
```

### Starting a DTail server farm

To spin up 10 instances of the `dserver` Docker image, run:

```shell
% make -C docker spinup
make: Entering directory '/home/paul/git/dtail/docker'
./spinup.sh 10
Creating dserver-serv0

Creating dserver-serv2
.
.
.
```

Now, have a look at the containers:

```shell
% docker ps

```

### Connecting to all 10 DTail servers

Have a look at `docker/Makefile` for some pre-defined commands. But one example would be:

```shell
make -C docker dtail
```

This will launch `dtail` and follow the `dserver` log files of all 10 containers.

### Stopping all Docker containers again

Just run this:

```shell
make -C docker spindown
```
